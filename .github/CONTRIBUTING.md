# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the Minesweeper game at miner.airat.top. Contributions of all kinds are welcome, including bug reports, gameplay improvements, and UI polish.

## How to Help

- **Report bugs or suggest enhancements** by opening an issue on GitHub. Please include clear reproduction steps, your browser and OS, and the selected difficulty.
- **Improve documentation** by fixing typos or clarifying usage details in the README.
- **Submit pull requests** for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript improvements, accessibility, or performance tweaks.

## Before You Start

- Read the repository `README.md` to understand the project goals and constraints.
- Keep changes focused. If you have multiple unrelated ideas, open separate pull requests.
- This is a static site with no build step. Keep dependencies minimal and avoid adding external services or trackers.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a feature branch that describes your work (for example, `feature/better-hints`).
3. Make your changes and keep commits scoped and meaningful.
4. Validate the changes locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.
5. Test multiple difficulty levels and verify win/loss behavior.
6. Open a pull request against the `main` branch and describe what changed and how you verified it.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] The game works by opening `index.html` directly (no build step required).
- [ ] No console errors in the browser.
- [ ] Game logic behaves correctly (wins, losses, and resets).
- [ ] UI works on both desktop and mobile screens.
- [ ] Documentation updated if user-facing behavior changed.

## Code Style and Standards

- Keep the project lightweight and easy to run locally.
- Use clear, readable vanilla JavaScript and CSS that matches existing style.
- Prefer accessibility-friendly patterns (keyboard use, contrast, focus states).

## Security and Responsible Disclosure
